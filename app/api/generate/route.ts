    if (tileSheet === true) {
      fullPrompt = `You are restyling a structural reference image for a side-view 2D platformer tile set. The reference is attached.

THE REFERENCE — what it shows:
- A rectangular platform silhouette on a flat magenta (#FF00FF) background.
- The rectangle has a smaller rectangular hole cut out of its middle, so the silhouette has FOUR outer convex corners at its outside, FOUR inner concave corners at the hole's corners, four straight outer edges (top / bottom / left / right of the rectangle), and four straight inner edges (the walls around the hole).
- Gray = "paint platform material here" — replace it with the user's material art.
- Magenta = "empty keyed background" — must remain perfectly flat pure #FF00FF.

ABSOLUTE RULES (these are not suggestions):
1. SAME SILHOUETTE: the output has the EXACT SAME silhouette as the reference. The same pixels are material, the same pixels are empty. Do NOT move, resize, soften, round, or redraw any edge.
2. FILL THE CANVAS: the platform's outer rectangle reaches the same outer extent as the reference (the reference has a ~25%-cell magenta margin on each side; match that margin exactly). DO NOT shrink the platform smaller, DO NOT center it inside a larger empty margin, DO NOT add extra magenta around the outside. If you find yourself drawing a platform that occupies less than ~85% of the canvas width/height, you are wrong — scale it up.
3. FLAT MAGENTA: wherever the reference is magenta, the output is perfectly flat solid pure magenta #FF00FF (R=255, G=0, B=255). No gradient, no shading, no halo, no anti-alias bleed. The hole in the middle is also flat magenta.
4. MATERIAL ONLY IN GRAY: wherever the reference is gray, paint the user's material. The gray itself is a placeholder — never copy plain gray into the final art.
5. NO PINK / RED-MAGENTA INSIDE THE MATERIAL. The material's color is its natural color. The client deletes ANY pixel where (R > 200 AND G < 80 AND B > 200), so:
   - Brick mortar between bricks must be DARK GRAY, TAN, or DEEP BROWN — never pink, never reddish-magenta.
   - Lava cracks must be ORANGE / YELLOW / RED-ORANGE — never pink-magenta.
   - Crystal highlights must be BLUE / WHITE / CYAN — never pink-magenta.
   - Flowers, gems, or any decoration must NOT use any color that crosses the magenta threshold above.
   - There must be ZERO thin pink stripes anywhere inside the material region. Boundaries between material and magenta are crisp organic edges with NO intermediate transition color.
6. CONTINUOUS PAINTING — the platform is ONE shape, painted as ONE continuous surface. Do NOT divide it into a grid of separate beveled blocks. Do NOT add visible boundary lines, mortar gaps, or seams at any internal location.

ART DIRECTION:
- FLAT 2D SIDE-VIEW only. NOT a 3D render, NOT isometric, NOT top-down. NO perspective, NO depth, NO extruded side faces on individual cells, NO drop shadows behind cells, NO bevels that suggest the platform is a stack of chiseled blocks. The whole platform reads as a flat painted shape against the magenta.
- For LAYERED materials (grass on dirt, snow on rock, moss on stone): apply the TOP CAP (grass / snow / moss) ONLY along TOP-FACING edges. There are EXACTLY TWO top-facing edges:
   1. The TOP edge of the outer rectangle (the platform's outermost top surface), wrapping continuously across the top-left and top-right outer corners. The cap MUST be visible at the four outer corners, not just the middle of the top edge — do not let the cap fade or stop before reaching the corner.
   2. The BOTTOM edge of the hole (the surface a player would land on if standing INSIDE the hole), wrapping continuously across the hole's bottom-left and bottom-right inner corners.
  Everywhere else shows the CORE material (dirt / rock / stone) with core detail (roots / cracks / chips / minerals). The cap is at most ~15% of the platform's vertical extent. Specifically there is NO CAP on: the BOTTOM edge of the outer rectangle (platform underside), the TOP edge of the hole (a "ceiling" from inside the hole — players cannot stand there), the LEFT or RIGHT vertical edges of either the outer rectangle or the hole.
- For HOMOGENEOUS materials (red brick, lava rock, crystal ice, wood planks): paint the same material throughout, with consistent palette and texture detail. Use SUBTLE lighting cues (slightly darker undersides, slightly brighter tops) instead of a separate top cap. Bricks / planks / blocks should NOT have visible 3D side faces; render them as flat 2D pattern on a continuous shape.
- NO INTERIOR HIGHLIGHT STRIPES OR ACCENT BARS. The interior of every brick face / plank face / stone block / etc. is a uniform color of the natural material with only small-scale natural texture (subtle grain, tiny pebbles, hairline cracks). The model is forbidden from painting:
   - Bright vertical highlight stripes through brick faces (a common red-brick failure).
   - Glowing accent lines, "shiny" streaks, or specular bars across stone / wood / ice blocks.
   - Bright diagonal slashes across any individual tile-unit of the pattern.
   - Any bright colored line that runs the full height or full width of the canvas.
  Lighting on a brick / plank / block is ambient and even across its face. If the model finds itself painting a 2-4 px bright stripe inside a brick or a plank, that is wrong — remove it and keep the face uniform.
- INNER CORNERS (the four cells at the corners of the hole, where the platform's interior wraps around the hole): paint these as continuous interior material identical to the adjacent body cells, with a clean ~25%×25% square magenta bite at the cell corner that faces the hole. The bite is a hard right-angle square — do not round it, do not make it bigger, do not let it grow toward a third of the cell. The bite's two edges carry the same organic surface detail as the adjacent straight edges of the hole. CRITICAL: the brick / plank / stone / texture pattern in an inner-corner cell must be CONTINUOUS with the adjacent body and edge cells — same brick row offset, same plank direction, same crack scale, same palette. An inner-corner cell that visibly differs from its neighbors (darker, different brick layout, different shading) is a failure.
- BODY TILE-FRIENDLINESS — the platform interior (rows / cells away from the cap edge and away from the hole) is going to be CROPPED into a single tile and REPEATED in a 2D game grid. For that to be invisible, the interior must be small-scale and uniform:
   - DO NOT paint cell-sized panels, square patches, vertical columns, horizontal rows, or subtle rectangular shading blocks inside the interior. The viewer must NOT be able to guess where the 512×512 body tile boundary will be.
   - NO long streaks that run the full height or full width of a cell. Long vertical roots that span top-to-bottom of the cell, long cracks that span left-to-right, long mortar lines that span the full width — all forbidden. Roots / cracks / mortar lines are SHORT segments (no more than about a third of the cell extent).
   - NO large geometric patterns invented by the model — no diamond scales, no hexagonal facets, no faceted plates, no large repeating decorative shapes. Stone is craggy and uneven, not crystalline. Snow/ice surfaces are smooth or finely cracked, not diamond-scaled.
   - NO single "hero" feature in the interior (one big crack, one large stone, one big root cluster).
   - The interior pattern density and scale is IDENTICAL in every region of the platform. If a 128-pixel patch of the interior is sampled from any position, it must look interchangeable with a 128-pixel patch from any other interior position.
- Even ambient lighting across the whole image. No directional shadows, no vignette, no center spotlight, no hero crack, no centered decorative cluster. Texture detail (cracks, moss, flowers, pebbles, chips, stains) is small-to-medium and evenly distributed.
- Palette and texture scale are LOCKED across the whole material region — same crack scale, same moss density, same color values everywhere there is material.
- No grid lines, no labels, no text, no captions, no arrows, no UI chrome.

The user's material is: "${prompt.trim()}". Paint this material onto the gray region of the reference exactly. Keep the magenta exactly as it is. Fill the canvas.${

This image will be used downstream as a VISUAL ANCHOR for generating an 8-frame animation sprite-sheet — the model that paints those 8 frames will be shown THIS image and asked to match it exactly. The creature's appearance in this image therefore needs to be definitive, readable, and crisp.

${anchorPlan.pose}

COMPOSITION:
- Character is centered horizontally in the frame.
${anchorPlan.composition}
- The full character is visible — no body parts cut off by the frame edges, no zoom-in on the face, no head-only portrait.

BACKGROUND:
- The background OUTSIDE the character silhouette MUST be perfectly flat solid pure magenta exactly ${KEY_COLOR_HEX} (R=255, G=0, B=255).
- The magenta fills every pixel that is not part of the character. No gradient, no shading, no halo, no anti-alias bleed.
- The character's own pixels MUST AVOID pure magenta colors — no hot pink hair, no pure magenta clothing, no pure magenta jewels. If you'd otherwise paint magenta, choose a slightly desaturated cousin (rose, hot pink with more red, etc.) so the chroma-key doesn't eat it.

ART DIRECTION:
- Crisp silhouette against the magenta. NO drop shadow, NO ground plane, NO motion blur, NO ground decorations.
- Even ambient lighting — no directional cast shadows on the character, no rim light, no center spotlight.
- No text, no captions, no labels, no UI, no health bars, no signature, no watermark.

THE CHARACTER IS: "${prompt.trim()}".

Paint that creature in the neutral pose described above, with pure flat ${KEY_COLOR_HEX} magenta everywhere else. The output is ONE SINGLE CHARACTER, not a sheet, not a grid, not multiple poses — just one definitive reference at ${width}×${height} pixels.`

      // image-gen call:
      //   1. STRUCTURAL GUIDE IMAGE. When `spriteGuideImage` is attached,
      //      it's a 2048×1024 PNG with the anchor character pre-placed in
      //      each of the 8 cells at pixel-locked position/scale/baseline.
      //      This is by far the strongest known consistency lever — far
      //      stronger than a loose anchor reference, because the model now
      //      has concrete pixel coordinates to anchor position and scale
      //      against, the way tile generation uses its gray-shape guide.
      //      Prompt explicitly tells the model NOT to copy the neutral
      //      pose, only the spatial layout.
      //   2. IN-PLACE / STATIONARY language. Without it, the model
      //      translates the character horizontally across cells (the
      //      single most common failure mode for walk/run cycles).

}

HOW TO USE THE POSE MAP — every one of these is mandatory:
- MATCH THE POSE EXACTLY: In each output cell, pose the creature so it lines up with that cell's mannequin — ${poseParts.match} Do NOT invent your own pose; do NOT default to a neutral resting pose.
- ${poseParts.depth}
- ${poseParts.sameStays}
- DO NOT DRAW THE MANNEQUIN: The grey mannequin is scaffolding only. Replace it with the fully-drawn creature (skin, fur, scales, feathers, outfit). No grey sticks, joints, or dots in the final image — but DO keep its light-near / dark-far shading.
- ${poseParts.facing}
- POSITION & SCALE: The creature occupies the SAME footprint as the mannequin in each cell — ${poseParts.footprint} Follow it.
- IDENTITY: Every cell is the SAME creature — ${hasIdentity ? 'the one in IMAGE 1' : 'consistent across all cells'}: same colors, markings, proportions, features. ONLY the pose changes between cells.
- BACKGROUND: Outside the creature silhouette, every pixel is flat pure magenta ${KEY_COLOR_HEX}. No grid lines, no cell borders, no leftover grey.

The choreography text below NAMES each pose so you understand the motion, but the POSE MAP is the authority on the exact configuration for each frame. When in doubt, trust the mannequin.`

STRUCTURAL GUIDE (ATTACHED IMAGE — READ THIS CAREFULLY, THIS IS HOW WE FIX FLICKER):
The image attached to this request is a STRUCTURAL TEMPLATE. It is a ${cols * cellPx}×${rows * cellPx} canvas already laid out as a ${cols}×${rows} grid of ${cellPx}×${cellPx} cells. In each of the ${frames} cells, the character has been pre-placed in a NEUTRAL standing pose at the EXACT position, scale, and baseline they must occupy in the final sheet. The background is flat magenta ${KEY_COLOR_HEX}.

USE THIS GUIDE AS A SPATIAL ANCHOR — every one of these is mandatory:
- POSITION: The character in each output cell MUST be at the SAME (x, y) pixel position inside its cell as in the guide. Do NOT shift the character left, right, up, or down between cells.
- SCALE: The character in each output cell MUST be at the SAME vertical extent (head-top to feet) as in the guide. Do NOT draw the character larger or smaller in any cell.
- BASELINE: The character's feet MUST sit at the SAME y-coordinate inside the cell as in the guide. Imagine a horizontal line across the whole canvas at the foot level of the guide — every output frame's feet must land on that line (or, for airborne frames in jump/run, above it by the choreographed amount).
- IDENTITY: The character in every output cell MUST be the EXACT SAME character shown in every cell of the guide: same outfit, same colors, same hairstyle, same weapon, same proportions, same face. The guide is the ground truth for what the character looks like.
- BACKGROUND: The flat magenta ${KEY_COLOR_HEX} in the guide is preserved EXACTLY in the output — outside the character silhouette, every pixel stays pure magenta.

CRITICAL — DO NOT JUST COPY THE GUIDE:
The guide shows the character in the SAME NEUTRAL POSE in all ${frames} cells. You are NOT being asked to reproduce that. Your job is to REPLACE THE POSE in each cell with the choreography pose described below, WHILE preserving position, scale, baseline, identity, and background EXACTLY. If your output shows the same neutral pose in every cell, you have failed the task — read the choreography section and use the prescribed pose for each cell.`
        : ''

      fullPrompt = `You are generating a single SPRITE-SHEET IMAGE: a ${cols}×${rows} grid of ${frames} animation keyframes for a 2D side-view game character. Each grid cell is exactly ${cellPx}×${cellPx} pixels. The full sheet is exactly ${cols * cellPx}×${rows * cellPx} pixels, a WIDE ${cols * cellPx}:${rows * cellPx} canvas — NOT a square canvas and NOT a screenshot/mockup containing a smaller sheet.${guideBlock}

GRID LAYOUT (single most important rule — read it twice):
- The output is ONE IMAGE containing ${frames} separate frames laid out as ${cols} columns × ${rows} rows.
- Reading order is ROW-MAJOR: top-left cell is FRAME 1, then left-to-right across the top row, then left-to-right across the next row. Concretely: (col=0, row=0)=FRAME 1, (col=1, row=0)=FRAME 2, ..., (col=${cols - 1}, row=0)=FRAME ${cols}, then (col=0, row=1)=FRAME ${cols + 1}, ..., (col=${cols - 1}, row=${rows - 1})=FRAME ${frames}.
- EACH CELL CONTAINS EXACTLY ONE FRAME of the animation, fully drawn inside that cell. Do NOT draw multiple poses in one cell. Do NOT draw the character spanning multiple cells. Do NOT draw a film-strip with sprocket holes — there are NO visible cell borders, gridlines, frame numbers, frame labels, or separators between cells in the output.
- EXACTLY ONE SINGLE CHARACTER PER CELL — this is the most important rule. Each cell shows ONE figure, centered. NEVER paint the character twice in the same cell: no twin, no clone, no duplicate, no mirror image, no reflection, no shadow-copy, no "before/after" pair, no second figure standing beside the main one. If you find yourself about to place a second character next to the first inside one cell, STOP — that is the single worst possible error for this task. One cell = one character.
- HARD CELL BOUNDARIES: each ${cellPx}×${cellPx} cell is a CLIPPING BOX. The creature in a cell must stay fully inside that cell. No head, tail, wing, leg, body, shadow, fur, or motion shape may cross into the neighbouring cell above, below, left, or right.
- MAGENTA GUTTER: leave at least ~8% of the cell as flat magenta margin around the creature inside every cell. For long creatures (wolves, snakes, birds with wings), scale the creature DOWN so the entire nose-to-tail / wingtip-to-wingtip silhouette fits comfortably inside one cell. Never crop a creature at the cell edge.
- The MAGENTA background is CONTINUOUS across the whole sheet wherever the character isn't drawn. There is no white line, dark line, or pink stripe between cells.

ONE CONTINUOUS ANIMATION (critical — do NOT split the sheet into two animations):
- All ${frames} cells are a SINGLE cycle of ONE motion: ${animType.toUpperCase()}. They are NOT two separate animations and NOT two different gaits. The cells flow 1 → ${frames} as one smooth progression, and frame ${frames} loops back into frame 1.
- The bottom row (cells ${cols + 1}–${frames}) is the CONTINUATION of the SAME cycle as the top row (cells 1–${cols}) — identical motion type, identical energy, identical forward lean, identical stride length and scale. It is the SECOND HALF of one animation, not a calmer second animation.
- NEVER render the top row as one motion (e.g. a fast run/gallop) and the bottom row as a different, slower motion (e.g. a walk or a stand). If the requested animation is ${animType.toUpperCase()}, EVERY one of the ${frames} cells — top row AND bottom row — must clearly be the SAME ${animType.toUpperCase()} motion at the SAME intensity.
- Use the per-frame choreography below for the exact pose of each numbered cell, including the bottom-row cells; those are mid-cycle poses of the SAME motion, not a second gait.

FRAME ALIGNMENT (this kills "flicker"):
- SAME BASELINE — the character's FEET sit on the SAME horizontal line in every cell. ${hasGuide ? 'Match the guide image\'s foot baseline pixel-for-pixel.' : 'Imagine drawing one straight horizontal line across the whole sheet at the character\'s foot level; every frame\'s feet touch that line.'} (For airborne frames in jump/run, the feet are above the line by the SAME amount each time, not at random heights.)
- SAME EYE LEVEL — the character's HEAD/EYES sit at the SAME horizontal line in every cell (with small natural variation from breathing or crouching, never more than ~10% of cell height).
- SAME SCALE — the character occupies the SAME vertical extent (head-top to feet) in every cell. Do NOT draw the character larger or smaller in different cells.
- SAME HORIZONTAL POSITION — the character's CENTER sits at the SAME relative horizontal position inside its cell across all frames. The character does NOT slide left or right across cells. Animations like walk and run are STATIONARY / "in place" — treat the character as if on an invisible treadmill. There is exactly ONE character centered in each cell — never a left-and-right pair of figures.
- CELL-SAFE SCALE — the complete silhouette must remain inside the same ${cellPx}×${cellPx} cell in every frame, with a magenta gutter. If a pose is long (quadruped tail/head, serpent body, wing span), make it smaller rather than letting it cross the hidden grid boundary.
- IDENTICAL CHARACTER — same outfit, same colors, same silhouette, same proportions, same head, same hair, same weapon in every cell. ONLY the pose changes.

BACKGROUND (every cell, no exceptions):
- Background outside the character silhouette is perfectly flat solid pure magenta exactly ${KEY_COLOR_HEX} (R=255, G=0, B=255).
- No gradient, no shading, no halo, no anti-alias bleed inside the magenta.
- The character's own pixels MUST AVOID pure magenta colors — no hot pink hair, no pure magenta clothing, no pure magenta jewels. The chroma-key downstream removes any pixel where (R > 200 AND G < 80 AND B > 200), so use slightly desaturated cousins (rose, hot pink with more red) if the character needs a magenta-adjacent color.

ART DIRECTION:
- Side-view (profile), character facing RIGHT in every cell.
- Crisp silhouette against the magenta. NO drop shadow, NO ground plane, NO ground line drawn, NO motion blur lines outside the character, NO ground decorations.
- Even ambient lighting — no directional cast shadows on the character, no rim light, no center spotlight.
- No text, no captions, no frame numbers, no UI, no health bars, no signature, no watermark.

ABSOLUTE RULES:

2. NO PINK / RED-MAGENTA inside the prop art. The client deletes any pixel where (R>200 AND G<80 AND B>200), so flowers, crystals, mushrooms must use colors that do NOT cross that threshold (favor greens, blues, cyans, oranges, yellows, whites, browns, and purples kept below R=200). Edges between prop and magenta must be crisp — NO intermediate pink transition.
3. FLAT 2D SIDE-VIEW only — NOT 3D, NOT isometric, NOT top-down. No perspective, no cast shadows, no horizon.
